## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review my notes for each section. There is a section for HTML, Git, CSS, and Javasript. To get a suggestion on what to study, you can open the console using Shift-Ctrl-I to open the console and on there you will see a recommendation on what to study. Each time you reload the page the option should change.
